			<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
			
			<p>I'm thrilled to be applying for the Part-Time Digital Coordinator role at Omnian Music Group. I'm a long time indie music listener, and always try to keep my eyes open for interesting thing happening at smaller labels. I've been following Kero Kero Bonito's work with Polyvinyl forever, I'm enamored with microlabels like Death By Sheep and 909 Worldwide, and of course I loved Captured Tracks work with Mac DeMarco. I'm currently rapping up T4Tapes, a compilation cassette showcasing the work of upcoming NYC transgender punk and D.I.Y musicians that I organized and produced. I was incredibly excited when I saw the Digital Coordinator listing because I knew it was the perfect job for me to utilize the skills I developed on that project, while giving me the opportunity to level up in terms of size and scope of the work and artists.  
			</p>
			
			<p>T4Tapes(which you should check out on Instagram and Bandcamp) was a music industry crash course for me. The process required heavy scheduling, networking, and analog production research. Our team was incredibly small and at times I had to do basically every job required for an albums release cycle. I put on a lot of hats, I spent time as music producer, social media manager, product designer, distributor, tape manufacturer, documentarian, and even electronics repairman. Not only was it a great learning experience but my work paid off with the entire 200 piece first edition having sold out, including selling out our stock at Rough Trade TWICE!
			</p>
			
			<p>Outside of my T4Tapes work I have a great amount of editing and social media experience. I've taken an extensive amount of video editing courses during my time at NYU and am more than proficient in softwares like Premiere Pro and Avid Media Composer. I've even worked on large film projects, doing extensive editing and research work on the Toronto International Film Festival-screened Batman parody film The People's Joker. Recently I've been doing some freelance videography and editing work, with my most notable client being Hillary Clinton's hair stylist Antonio Vellota. Through some social media management and content creation I helped him achieve his goal of becoming the star of his own content. Personally, I use social media pretty scarcely but I have good understanding of what performs well and often have posts that do great like this one, this one, and this one. 
			</p>
			
			<p>I think I have the skills to thrive in this position and am hungry to venture deeper into the music industry. Thank you for taking the time to look over my application and I'm ecstatic to hear back from you. 
			</p>
			
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
